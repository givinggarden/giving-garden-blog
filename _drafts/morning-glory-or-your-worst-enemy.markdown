Waking up to a garden filled with sunflowers adorned in morning glories sounds like a dream. Their ability to lace houses can transform any old house into something you see from a storybook. Yet isn't it ironic that these little blue beauties are actually a gardener's worst nightmare?

Our team was taking a stroll around one of the Davis community gardeners when we ran into a local long-time gardener, who told us the background of how the morning glories came to be such infectious weeds affecting our Davis gardeners. 

In the 90's there were advertisements and seed packets distributed for something called a playhouse. The idea behind the packets was to build a playhouse with your sunflower seeds and then plant morning glories around them so they would grow around and up to adorn the sunflowers. The end result would be a beautiful floral playhouse in your garden. 

It was something as simple and harmless as the playhouse that lead to the invasive morning glory issue gardeners struggle with today in Davis. This deadly beauty is also sadly why our CEO, Deema, lost her green beans for this year's harvest.

As they say, "not all beautiful things are good." Well, in this case at least they aren't.
