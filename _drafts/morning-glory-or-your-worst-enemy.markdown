Waking up to a garden filled with sunflowers adorned in morning glories sounds like a dream. Their ability to lace houses can transform any old house into something you see from a storybook. Yet isn't it ironic that these little morning glories could be any gardener's worst nightmare?

Our team was taking a stroll around the community orchard where we ran into a local gardener named Eric who told us the background of how the morning glories came to be such infectious weeds affecting our Davis gardeners. We thought we'd like to share this little fun story with you!

In the 90's there was an advertisement for something called a playhouse. The idea was to build a playhouse with your sunflower seed packets, but morning glory packets were also planted so they would grow around and adorn the sunflower. The end result would be this beautiful floral playhouse in your garden. 

It was something as simple and harmless as the playhouse that lead to the invasive morning glory issue gardeners struggle with today. This is also sadly why our CEO, Deema, had lost her green beans for this year's harvest.

As they say, "not all beautiful things are good." Well, in this case at least they aren't.
