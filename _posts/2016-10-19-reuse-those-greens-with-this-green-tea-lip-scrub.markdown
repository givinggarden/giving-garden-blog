We came up with an easy and inexpensive DIY remedy that puts left overs from your hot tea to use, to cure those cold weather chapped lips. Our green tea scrub will quench your lips better than religiously reapplying chapstick every hour, an inefficient habit that doesn't work if your lips aren't properly exfoliated!

You may not have known, but green tea is just as good for you on the outside as it is on the inside? It provides antioxidants and vitamin B for your skin. It also reduces redness and swelling. 

So let's get started. 

Step 1: Save your left over leaves from your cup of tea. You'll want to do this with tea leaves that have already opened, so that way they are properly activated and moist.

Step 2: Gather your ingredients:
- tea leaves; 2 teaspoons
- sugar, brown sugar, or cane sugar; 2 tablespoons
- olive oil; 1 teaspoon or until everything is combined well
- an empty container

We highly suggest local ingredients because they provide the best and freshest quality to make this scrub for your skin. When it comes to putting something on your skin, it's very important to have clean and non-harmful products.

Step 3: Mix everything together and tada! You have your very own lip scrub. 

We bet you already had these ingredients inside your kitchen, too. Reuse your coffee grounds for more texture or use leftover beet juice (from your garden beets) to make it a tinted scrub. Get creative; there are so many ways to reuse your food. Don't let any of those goodies go to waste!
