If you love Lord of the Rings, magicians or fantastical things you should try growing your own food. When you put a plant or seed in the ground and you watch it grow and become an amazing bounty of fresh, yumminess you'll feel like a powerful and awesome gardening wizard. It's magical. 

It's also healthy, good for the environment, and a great way to calm nerves and recharge from our screen-time crammed lives. 

But mainly it's fun to feel like a wizard. And fresh tomatoes kick all store bought tomatoes to the curb.
