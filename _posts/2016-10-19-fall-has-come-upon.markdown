Fall has come upon us and although we all can appreciate the gloomy skies, switching from smoothies to warmer drinks, and colorful leaves, we can definitely do without the dry cracking skin that typically happens during the colder seasons.

We came up with an easy and extremely cheap DIY remedy to chapped lips that will do you more justice than religiously reapplying chapstick every hour, which does not work as efficiently as you think if your lips are not properly exfoliated!

Did you know green tea was just as good for you on the outside as it is on the inside? It provides antioxidants and vitamin B for your skin. It also reduces redness and swelling. 

Save the left over leaves from your cup of tea. You want to do this with tea leaves that have already opened, so that way they are properly activated and moist, otherwise you'd be just rubbing dry leaves on your skin.

You will need:
- tea leaves; 2 teaspoons
- sugar, brown sugar, or cane sugar; 2 tablespoons
- olive oil; 1 teaspoon or until everything is combined well
- an empty container

We highly suggest local ingredients because they provide the best and freshest quality to make this scrub for your skin. When it comes to putting something your skin, it is very important to have clean and non-harmful products.

Mix everything together and tada! You have your very own lip scrub. We bet you already had these ingredients inside your kitchen, too! Reuse your coffee grounds, use leftover beet juice to make it a tinted scrub. Get creative; there are so many ways to reuse your food. Don't let any of those goodies go to waste!
